 * Usage:
 *   psql -d database_name -f administration/partition_management.sql
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - PostgreSQL 10+ (native partitioning)
 *   - Privileges: pg_monitor role or table owner permissions
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Partition hierarchy and distribution
 *   - Partition size analysis and balance
 *   - Partition pruning effectiveness
 *   - Maintenance recommendations
 *   - Automated partition management suggestions
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Essential for partitioned table maintenance
