/*
 * Script: postgres_locking_blocking.sql
 * Purpose: Advanced lock analysis showing blocking relationships between queries
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   psql -d database_name -f monitoring/postgres_locking_blocking.sql
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - PostgreSQL 15+
 *   - Privileges: pg_monitor role recommended
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Blocking PID (the blocker)
 *   - Blocked PID (the waiter)
 *   - Blocking query
 *   - Blocked query
 *   - Lock type causing the block
 *   - Wait duration
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Use when queries are hanging or timing out
 *   - Blocking PID can be terminated if necessary: SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);
 *   - Long-running blocking queries may need optimization
 *   - Consider query timeout settings for problematic applications
 *   - Empty result means no blocking is occurring
