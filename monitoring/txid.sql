/*
 * Script: txid.sql
 * Purpose: Monitor transaction ID usage and wraparound risk
 *
 * Usage:
 *   psql -d database_name -f monitoring/txid.sql
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - PostgreSQL 9.0+
 *   - Privileges: Any user (uses public views)
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Current transaction ID
 *   - Database age (in transactions)
 *   - Percent to wraparound
 *   - Tables with oldest frozen XID
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - CRITICAL: Monitor regularly to prevent wraparound shutdown
 *   - Age > 1 billion transactions is concerning
 *   - Age > 2 billion forces database shutdown
 *   - High age requires aggressive VACUUM
 *   - autovacuum_freeze_max_age controls automatic freezing
 *   - Consider manual VACUUM FREEZE for high-age tables
