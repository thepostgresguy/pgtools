/*
 * Script: buffer_troubleshoot.sql
 * Purpose: Analyze shared buffer usage and cache hit ratios
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   psql -d database_name -f monitoring/buffer_troubleshoot.sql
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - PostgreSQL 9.0+
 *   - Privileges: pg_monitor role recommended
 *   - Extension: pg_buffercache (must be installed)
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Buffer cache statistics
 *   - Cache hit ratios by table
 *   - Tables with poor caching
 *   - Buffer usage distribution
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Cache hit ratio should be >95% for good performance
 *   - Low ratios indicate need for more shared_buffers or query optimization
 *   - Install pg_buffercache: CREATE EXTENSION pg_buffercache;
 *   - Can be resource-intensive, avoid running frequently on busy systems
