/*
 * Script: wait_event_analysis.sql
 * Purpose: Comprehensive analysis of PostgreSQL wait events and performance bottlenecks
 * 
 * This script analyzes wait events to identify performance bottlenecks in PostgreSQL.
 * Wait events indicate what processes are waiting for and help diagnose performance issues.
 * 
 * Requires: PostgreSQL 10+, pg_stat_activity access
 * Privileges: pg_monitor role or superuser
 * 
 * Usage: psql -f performance/wait_event_analysis.sql
 * 
 * Author: pgtools
