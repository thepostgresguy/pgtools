/*
 * Script: missing_indexes.sql
 * Purpose: Identify potentially beneficial indexes based on query patterns and table usage
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   psql -d database_name -f optimization/missing_indexes.sql
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - PostgreSQL 15+
 *   - pg_stat_statements extension enabled (for query analysis)
 *   - Privileges: pg_monitor role or pg_stat_all_tables access
 *
 * Output:
 *   - Tables with high sequential scan ratios
 *   - Columns frequently used in WHERE clauses without indexes
 *   - Foreign key columns missing indexes
 *   - Unused indexes that could be dropped
 *   - Index recommendations with estimated benefit
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Requires pg_stat_statements: CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
 *   - Analysis improves with longer observation periods
 *   - Consider table size and query frequency when implementing suggestions
 *   - Test index impact on INSERT/UPDATE performance
 *   - Review recommendations with actual query plans
